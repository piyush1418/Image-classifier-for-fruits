# üçé Fruit Image Classification using CNN

This project focuses on classifying different types of fruits using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras. The model is trained on the Fruits 360 dataset, which contains images of over 130 different fruits.

## üìå Project Overview

- Classifies fruit images into multiple categories with high accuracy.
- Uses data augmentation and image preprocessing for better model performance.
- Includes model evaluation and visualization.
- Optional: Deployed using Streamlit/Flask for real-time predictions.

## üß† Model Architecture

- Input Layer (Resized images: 100x100 pixels)
- Convolutional Layers + ReLU + MaxPooling
- Dropout Layer to prevent overfitting
- Dense (Fully Connected) Layers
